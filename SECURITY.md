## Reporting a Vulnerability

We use GitHub's native Private Vulnerability Reporting to handle security issues discreetly and safely. This protects the community by ensuring a fix is available before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.
