# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take the security of our library seriously. The table below outlines the versions currently receiving security updates and patches.

| Version | Supported                    |

| 0.0.x   | :x: End of Life (EOL)        |

> [!TIP]
> We recommend all users upgrade to the latest version available on [npm/package/amqp-suite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amqp-suite) to ensure they have the most recent security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We use GitHub's native Private Vulnerability Reporting to handle security issues discreetly and safely. This protects the community by ensuring a fix is available before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### How to report:

1. Navigate to the [[Security]](https://github.com/iamcarlosdaniel/amqp-suite/security) tab at the top of this repository.

2. Click the button [[Report a vulnerability]](https://github.com/iamcarlosdaniel/amqp-suite/security/advisories/new).

3. Provide a detailed description, including steps to reproduce and a proof-of-concept (PoC) if possible.

## Our Process

We handle each report through an agile three-stage process that ensures an initial response within 72 hours, prioritizes the fix and immediate release on npm, and concludes with a coordinated public disclosure to ensure transparency and protect our community.

Thank you for helping keep this project and the npm ecosystem safe!
